# Revised Calenviroscreen: Single indicators relevant for wildlife -> re-aggregate.
# temperature + noise pollution alongside cal enviro screen score
# Use the following from CalEnviroScreen: Led risk housing, ground water threats, pm2.5 , diesel pm, toxic release from facility, hazard waste gnerators and facility, cleanup sites
# Create a pollution lvl burden from those scores together: 
# Environmental quality as a co-variate
# Scale and normalize into one score



# % Greenspace:
# NDVI 10m sentinel
# Get better impericous surface

# Dist2coast:
# Dist2greenspace
# Openspace
# Daily Tmax, Tmin, Rain
# single-multi housing, vacancy, no cars
# roads density
# elevation in m
# Add nightlights NASA VIIRS 1km2 scale
# Noise?
# other impervious surface -> 
# Infrastructure + presence + activity + Rosds? + 

# Next year goals: Ask Cassie for help using open data + climate + people _ open science and generative AI !!!
# Make a biodiversity access layer -> Cassie +
# Justice40 categorization of Disadvantaged communities -> 0 or 1 disadvantaged communities
# Biodiversity indicator + access

# huggingface.co/spaces/boettiger-lab/ca-30x30

# generative ai can use a chatbot that creates SQL query and extract the data

# Cassie + Chris + Carl + Rachael -> CalEnviroScreen ! 

# LLM connect to SQL to connect to DB -> data size -> we work with tile data -> Code is all open -> 

# Casie talk with Rachel Morello frosch -> Not arc gis sort of stuff
